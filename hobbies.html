        <h3>Cinema</h3>
        <div class="hobbiesp">
            <p>I've been a fan of the 7th art since I was very young. I've always enjoyed watching movies at home or in the cinema. It's a hobby I feel comfortable doing alone or with others. I watch all kinds of productions: movies, series, short films, etc. My favorite genres are comedy, action, history, war, and crime.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cinema has been present in our lives for a long time. In 1895, the French brother's Auguste and Louis Lumière held the first public cinema exhibition. However, the creation of cinema was the result of the efforts of several inventors who worked to record moving images.</p>

        <h3>Soccer</h3>
        <div class="hobbiesp">
            <p>Since I can remember watching football games with my father, I think the "addiction" started there. At the age of eight I started practicing at the club in my area and I loved it. It began to be practiced in England in the 17th century and since then it has undergone numerous changes since the addition of rules as well as the creation of sporting events such as: World Cup, Champions League, Europa League and several leagues around the globe.</p>
            <p>There are a lot of professional teams that have very talented players every year. Some can stand out, like Pelé, Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Maradona, Ronaldinho, etc.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <div class="hobbiesp">
            <p>It all started when I entered university, the need to cook for the first time to feed myself led me to discover an unexpected hobby. In the kitchen, everything has a solution, or actually several. I was never very attentive to recipes, I just asked several people how it would be best to cook a certain meal and I adjusted it to my taste.</p>
